           <p>On Ajualuv Workshops: "Grandma Rachel's Camp campers, consisting of young boys ages 10-12, greatly benefited from virtual conversations over Skype with Ms. Ajua on issues that arose from personal interactions and communal cohabitation.  She was able to provide helpful tools for controlling emotions, as well as for respecting each other's person and property, the camp grounds, and the counselors and volunteers.  The campers thoroughly enjoyed the sessions.  The information she shared allowed them to have a safe and enjoyable camp experience."</p>

           <p>On Reiki With Ajualuv: "I went to see Ajua when I was ready to make changes in my life and break patterns. I wanted to know what was going on energetically with myself and do the work to heal the past and move forward to match my life to my goals and desires. Ajua is a kind, compassionate and sharing individual. She helped me to understand the benefits of Reiki and the importance of quieting the mind in order to access intuition and receive guidance from the universe. Through Ajua's work I have made so much progress and feel I am on the road to an unshakable inner happiness to draw from as I work to live the life I want."</p>

           <p>On Ajualuv Workshops: "My interest and curiosity of learning more about holistic health led me to Ajualuv's seminar. And what a treat it was to hear her speak! Not only did I take away valuable insights on energy healing and natural remedies, her relatability and passion in sharing her knowledge on this subject matter renewed my excitement to continue to explore how I can incorporate holistic health into my life."</p>

           <p>On Ajualuv Workshops: "What a wonderful way to welcome in the spring with our newest energy healer Ajua Hawkins! "Healing is the flow of intentional energy," says Wayne Dyer.  If you want to create a healing event to just feel better, or to recover after trauma or hospitalization, Ajua can help. The sooner the public becomes aware of how their body is made up of energy, the sooner they will realize that energy must be balanced to give the individual optimal health. Ajua is a welcome change to the community of natural healing. Not only does Ajua do a wonderful job explaining and demonstrating the principles of Reiki, but she also incorporates other healing modalities such as herbalism and aromatherapy. I am so excited for the Philadelphia community and Ajualuv's upcoming events. In keeping with the concept of women healers in training, may God continue to bless Ajua on her healing journey."</p>
